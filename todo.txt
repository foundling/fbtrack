TO-DO LIST 
----------

architectural

- logging:
  - main logger instance that can log info, errors, etc. as well as log to file
  - figure out what should be logged to a file to debug failures later on.

regressions:
- re-running query when all data in window is collected

backlog
- write cli sub-command to 'bundle' collected data
x signup ui: allow override checkbox (plus confirm) to overwrite subjectId in db (re-registration)
- add quit button to main page.
- update error message to point out reauth checkbox if that's useful
- update report cli command with new subject/participant models
- cli interface issue: -p -a doesn't throw, but it means participant ids are ['-a']
- study api: is allowing either a flat data dir or subject_id based data subdirs worth it?
- handle edge case where '_' in participant id
- prevent refresh token errors. got a 400 invalid refresh token, with an old refresh token in db.
- let user pass subject id via cli to web (optional), by running 'fbt signup <subjectId>`.
