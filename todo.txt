TO-DO LIST 
----------

architectural

- logging:
  - main logger instance that can log info, errors, etc. as well as log to file
  - figure out what should be logged to a file to debug failures later on.

- concurrency
  - the ECONNRESET error: fixed ... but now it's slower.  
  - how to can you multiplex and maintain logging?
  - have query function return metadata about what was collected, log those upon participant query completion.
  - write some iteration mechanism on the study level to always pull n number of participants and query
    - on the participant level, it will do one day/metric at a time.
    - on the study level, it will do n participants at a time.


backlog
- signup ui: allow override checkbox (plus confirm) to overwrite subjectId in db (re-registration)
- cli interface issue: -p -a doesn't throw, but it means participant ids are ['-a']
- study api: is allowing either a flat data dir or subject_id based data subdirs worth it?
